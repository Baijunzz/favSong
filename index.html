      <h1>When You Look At Me by Sara Kays</h1>
      <p>
        Sara Kay's song, When You Look At Me, depicts a unique type of
        heartbreak. One that has yet to happen but however is currently
        happening too. In this song, Sara Kay feels lost as she desperetly
        pledes for the love that he once had with her current boyfriend.
        Although not broken up, it might as well had been one as Sara doesn't
        feel like the love they once had was still there.

      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <ul class="verse1">
        <li>I don't feel like you like me lately</li>
        <li>I don't feel like I'm pretty</li>
        <li>Do I have the same glow about me</li>
        <li>As that night in the city?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="pre-chorus">
        <li>When you told me I remind you of the moon</li>
        <li>I'm still holding onto that and onto you</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="chorus">
        <li>When you look at me, do you still think</li>
        <li>That I shine brighter than anyone?</li>
        <li>Or have you seen somebody else lately</li>
        <li>Who reminds you of the sun?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="verse2">
        <li>I've been hoping since late September</li>
        <li>That you'd act how you used to</li>
        <li>You keep saying you don't remember</li>
        <li>Hate that I have to tell you</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="pre-chorus">
        <li>How you told me I remind you of the moon</li>
        <li>And you'd hold me and that now you never do</li>

        <li>I know at your front door</li>
        <li>That I won't be spun around anymore</li>
        <li>And I know what I'm in for</li>
        <li>When I hope you love me like you did before</li>
        <li>And I know at your front door</li>
        <li>That I won't be spun around anymore</li>

      <h2>What Sara Kay has to say:</h2>
      <p>
        "'When You Look At Me' is about feeling like the person you're with
        doesn't look at you the same anymore, or act like they used to around
        you. I wrote this song about a month ago when I was feeling that way in
        my relationship, and decided to record it shortly after that while it
        was still real to me." - Sara Kays via Broadway World
